# Maintenance Policy (Read Before Opening Issues)

### 🛑 Status: "Works on My Machine" Ware
------

This repository is a **reference implementation**, not a managed software product. 

I built this to solve a specific problem on my specific hardware stack. It works perfectly for me. 

I am sharing it so you can learn from it, fork it, or copy it - but I am not your tech support.

## 🛠️ The "Golden" Hardware Stack
I only build, test, and validate this code on the following configuration:
* **Compute:** Raspberry Pi 5 (8GB)
* **WAN:** Gigabit USB 3.0 NIC (RTL8153/AX88179)
* **AP:** Netgear R7800 (Nighthawk X4S) running OpenWrt
* **Line:** 500/500 Mbps Fiber (PPPoE) (ONT)

If you have a Pi 4, a weird Realtek dongle, a different Access Point, or a 10Gbps line: **you are on your own.** 

## ♻️ Update Frequency

* **If it breaks for me:** I will fix it and push the update immediately.
* **If it breaks for you:** I will likely not fix it.

## 🤝 Contributing & Forking
- Do you want to add support for the Pi 4? 
- Do you want to build a GUI? 
- Do you want to fix a bug that only affects Starlink users?

### **Awesome. Please Fork it.**

------

I encourage you to take this code and make it your own:

- Build a better version.
- Release a "Universal Edition." 

**The code is free (MIT/GPL), but my time is not.**

------

### **TL;DR: No Issues. No Support. Fork and Own It.**
